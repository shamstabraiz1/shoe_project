# Image Placeholders Needed

For the showcase section to work properly, you'll need these image files in your project root:

## Bestseller Panel
- `bestseller-jordan-5.webp` - Main bestseller product image (300x300px recommended)

## Collection Gallery
- `dynamic-collection-1.webp` - Red canvas sneaker detail (400x300px recommended)
- `dynamic-collection-2.webp` - Person wearing red sneakers (400x300px recommended) 
- `dynamic-collection-3.webp` - Classic white sneakers (400x300px recommended)

## Mission Section
- `mission-team-exercise.webp` - Group of people exercising outdoors (800x500px recommended)

## Customer Testimonials
- `customer-1.webp` - Karen Kim customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `customer-2.webp` - Alexander M customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `customer-3.webp` - Selena Brown customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `customer-4.webp` - Michael Johnson customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `customer-5.webp` - Emma Davis customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `customer-6.webp` - David Wilson customer photo (300x300px recommended)
- `shoe-icon-1.webp` to `shoe-icon-6.webp` - Small shoe icons for each testimonial (50x50px recommended)

## Newsletter Section
- `li.jpeg` - Newsletter background image (1200x400px recommended)

## Background

You can replace these with your actual product images or use placeholder services like:
- https://picsum.photos/400/300 for temporary placeholders
- https://via.placeholder.com/400x300 for solid color placeholders

The code will gracefully handle missing images with alt text and error handling.
