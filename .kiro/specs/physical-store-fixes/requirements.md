# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the physical store management system of the Shoe Point admin dashboard. The system currently has problems with duplicate product additions, lacks return functionality, has non-functional search features, and requires category to be mandatory when it should be optional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Duplicate Product Addition Issue

**User Story:** As a store admin, I want to add only one product when I submit the add product form, so that my inventory remains accurate and I don't have duplicate entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit the add product form THEN the system SHALL add exactly one product to the inventory
2. WHEN I click the add product button multiple times THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate form submissions
3. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button until the operation completes
4. WHEN a product is successfully added THEN the system SHALL clear the form and close the modal
5. WHEN there are multiple event listeners attached THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate listeners before adding new ones

### Requirement 2: Implement Product Return Feature

**User Story:** As a store admin, I want to process product returns from customers, so that I can manage inventory accurately and provide good customer service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the physical sales section THEN the system SHALL display a returns management interface
2. WHEN I select a previous sale THEN the system SHALL show the sale details and allow partial or full returns
3. WHEN I process a return THEN the system SHALL increase the product stock by the returned quantity
4. WHEN I process a return THEN the system SHALL record the return transaction with timestamp and reason
5. WHEN I process a return THEN the system SHALL update the sales log to reflect the return
6. WHEN I view return history THEN the system SHALL display all processed returns with details
7. WHEN I process a return THEN the system SHALL validate that the return quantity does not exceed the original sale quantity

### Requirement 3: Implement Category Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a store admin, I want to search and filter products by category, so that I can quickly find specific types of shoes in my inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter products by name, category, or description in real-time
2. WHEN I select a category from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL show only products from that category
3. WHEN I use both search and category filter THEN the system SHALL apply both filters simultaneously
4. WHEN I clear the search or select "All Categories" THEN the system SHALL show all products
5. WHEN no products match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "No products found" message
6. WHEN I search for categories THEN the system SHALL be case-insensitive

### Requirement 4: Make Category Optional for New Products

**User Story:** As a store admin, I want to add products without specifying a category, so that I can quickly add items and categorize them later if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new product THEN the category field SHALL be optional
2. WHEN I submit a product form without a category THEN the system SHALL accept the product and assign a default category of "Uncategorized"
3. WHEN I view products without categories THEN the system SHALL display them with "Uncategorized" label
4. WHEN I edit a product THEN I SHALL be able to add or change the category
5. WHEN I filter by category THEN uncategorized products SHALL appear under "Uncategorized" option

### Requirement 5: Improve Form Validation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a store admin, I want clear feedback when adding or editing products, so that I understand what information is required and when operations succeed or fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a form with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL highlight the missing fields and show specific error messages
2. WHEN I successfully add or edit a product THEN the system SHALL show a success notification
3. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN I'm filling out the form THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
5. WHEN I submit a form THEN the system SHALL show a loading state until the operation completes
